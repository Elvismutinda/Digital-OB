# Digital_OB-Project

This is a personal project that I came up with to digitiz the operations of police stations in my country and also help in tracking entries made in the OB of a police station. The system also helps is evaluating trends in crime in the country.

The system is coded with CORE PHP and connected to MariaDB dataabase that stores the data. The front-end is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and the system is hosted on the Apache Server.

## How to get a Live Demo.

After Starting Apache and MySQL in XAMPP, follow the following steps:

### `Step 1:`

Download the Code and unzip it.

### `Step 2:`

Copy the main project folder and paste it in xampp/htdocs

### `Step 3:`

Open Browser and go to URL: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)

### `Step 4:`

Click on database tab and create database called digital_ob.

### `Step 5:`

Click on the import tab in the horizontal navbar and select "digital_ob.sql" file located in the "database" folder.

### `Step 6:`

Click on go at the bottom of the page.

After creating database go to URL: [http://localhost/digital_ob/](http://localhost/digital_ob/)

In my case digital_ob is my folder name. Replace it with whatever name you have given your project folder.
