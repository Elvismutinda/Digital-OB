# Digital_OB-Project

This is a personal project that I came up with to digitize the operations of police stations in my country and also help in tracking entries made in the OB of a police station. The system also helps in evaluating trends in crime in the country.

The system is coded in CORE PHP and connected to MariaDB dataabase that stores the data. The front-end is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
